# Bonus Information About Me

## Who am I?

¡Hi! My name is Elizabeth Andriano, I’m 19 years old and my biggest passion in life is to always learn something new. Since I was a child, I’ve liked to search and learn about my everything that landed into my hands, thus I’ve self-taught several activities such as programming in different languages, as well as hobbies like embroidering, photography, and linoleum carving. After the covid pandemic I decided that I never wanted to stop myself from doing what I love and now I’m part of different student societies associated to my degree or my hobbies.

I personally know how it feels to be the one who is left behind or discriminated, since I live with chronic pain, therefore I always look to make everyone feel included in any activity I participate, along with creating safe and accessible spaces where everyone’s voice is heard. I don’t believe that everyone should struggle the same way I did in the past, so I work to eradicate the hardships that I’ve encountered and want to make a positive impact with every person I interact.

## Why the program?

I got to know about the program thanks to a close friend of mine who was part of the first EGS GLP generation.
When he told me about his life within the program and the activities he did I could see the comfort and passion with which he narrated them, as well as the excitement that his experiences  in it brought him.
I like to help others and to make my environment better so those who surround me can have the best experience possible. I'm convinced that with time, and the appropiate tools, everyone can achieve their full potential, even when they are not aware of it. I believe the best way of being able to support them is by knowing myself and constantly improving, that"s why I want to be part of the Eugenio Garza Sada Global Leadership Program.
