# Who am I?

¡Hi! My name is Elizabeth Andriano, I’m 19 years old and my biggest passion in life is to always learn something new. Since I was a child, I’ve liked to search and learn about my everything that landed into my hands, thus I’ve self-taught several activities such as programming in different languages, as well as hobbies like embroidering, photography, and linoleum carving. After the covid pandemic I decided that I never wanted to stop myself from doing what I love and now I’m part of different student societies associated to my degree or my hobbies.

I personally know how it feels to be the one who is left behind or discriminated, since I live with chronic pain, therefore I always look to make everyone feel included in any activity I participate, along with creating safe and accessible spaces where everyone’s voice is heard. I don’t believe that everyone should struggle the same way I did in the past, so I work to eradicate the hardships that I’ve encountered and want to make a positive impact with every person I interact.
